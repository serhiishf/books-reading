## This project uses several libraries and technologies for efficient development and improving the user experience.

- React-router-dom - used for routing and navigating between pages in the application. There were some difficulties with setting up routes for registered and unregistered users.

- React-redux - used for managing the state of the application and exchanging data between components. There were some challenges in setting it up correctly, and it took a bit longer to learn than originally anticipated.

- Axios - used for sending requests to the server and retrieving data. An axiosInstance was also created for the proper handling of refresh and access tokens to update the current user data.

- React-datetime -datetime provides a convenient interface for working with dates and times in React.

- React-multi-carousel is used for creating image carousels and other content blocks on the application pages.

- Nivo is used for data visualization and creating diagrams, charts, and other visualization elements

- React-toastify - a simple and easy-to-use library for displaying notifications and messages on application pages.

- I18next - used for localizing the application interface in two languages. The main challenge was setting it up correctly, suitable for our project, and also understanding how it works in conjunction with Formik and Yup.

- React-loader-spinner - spinner is used to display an animated spinner during data loading. The challenge was understanding when and where to apply the loader.

- Formik Ð¸ Yup - are used together to simplify the process of creating and validating forms on the application pages. It took some time to find information on how to correctly describe validation.

## Each of these libraries and technologies may have its potential challenges, especially for developers without prior experience working with them. However, when used correctly, they can significantly simplify and improve the development process of your project.

## And the main difficulty was, in fact, the lack of experience working with the above-mentioned libraries.
